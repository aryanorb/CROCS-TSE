## 🔊 Overview
CROCS is a **two-stage target speaker extraction (TSE)** framework that exploits the cross-correlation for complex-spectra of the enrollment and mixture and dual post-refinements with low-dimensional embeddings.

## ✨ Key Features
- Interpretable complex-spectral cross-correlation
- Two-stage-based dual post-refinement
- Speaker embedding–conditioned adapters
